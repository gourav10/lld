#  Library Management System (LMS)

Let's simulate a Low-Level Design (LLD) interview for a Library Management System. I'll act as the interviewer, and we'll focus on your understanding of system design principles, coding approach, and ability to communicate effectively.

**Scenario**
You are tasked with designing a Library Management System that handles typical operations such as:

1. Adding and managing books.
2. Issuing and returning books.
3. Managing library users (students, staff).
4. Searching for books by title, author, or subject.
5. Maintaining records of issued books.
   

## 1. Problem Clarification and Scope Defination
Design a Library Management System to manage books, members, and transactions.
- Should the system handle physical books, e-books, or both?
- Do we need to support multiple libraries or just a single one?
- Should we consider additional features like overdue penalties, book reservations, or user notifications?
## 2. Core Functional Requirements Identification
### Functional Features
**1. User Management**
- Registration of users (e.g., students, staff).
- Managing user roles and privileges (e.g., admin, librarian, member).

**2. Book Management**
- Adding, updating, and removing books from the catalog.
- Managing book metadata such as title, author, ISBN, subject, and copies available.

**3. Search and Browse**
- Search for books by title, author, genre, or subject.
- Filter and sort results by availability, publication year, or relevance.

**4.Borrowing and Returning Books**
- Issue books to users based on availability and user borrowing limits.
- Track due dates and overdue fines (if applicable).
- Return books and update inventory.

**5. Reservation**
- Allow users to reserve books that are currently issued to someone else.
- Notify users when the reserved book becomes available.

**6. Notifications**
- Send reminders for due dates and overdue fines.
- Notify users about reserved books or system announcements.

**Transaction History**
- Maintain records of books issued, returned, and overdue fines paid.

**Reports and Analytics**
- Generate reports for inventory, user activity, overdue books, and fines collected.

### Administrative Features
**1. Inventory Management**
- Add, remove, or update book copies.
- Generate insights into the most/least borrowed books.

**2. Fine Management**
- Calculate and track overdue fines.
- Collect and manage payments.

**3. System Configuration**
- Set borrowing limits for users (e.g., max books, borrowing period).
- Manage holiday schedules and book reservation policies.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Scalability:** Ability to handle a large number of users and books.
2. **Reliability:** Accurate tracking of inventory and user transactions.
3. **Usability:** Intuitive interface for both library staff and users.
4. **Performance:** Fast search and transaction processing.
5. **Security:** Protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to administrative features.

## 3. Object-Oriented Design

## 4. Discussion on Extensibility and Scalability
