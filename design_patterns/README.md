# Types of Design Patterns
## 1. Creational Deisgn Pattern
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and re-use existing code.
1. [Factory Method](./factory_method/README.md): 
    - defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
    - It promotes loose coupling by delegating the responsibility of object instantiation.
2. [Abstract Factory Method](./abstract_factory/README.md): 
    - provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects.
3. Builder
4. Prototype
5. [Singleton](./singleton/README.md)
