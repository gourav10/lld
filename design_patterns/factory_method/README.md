# Factory Method
The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It promotes loose coupling by delegating the responsibility of object instantiation.

## Real-Life Example:
A logistics company might use a factory method to create different types of transport (e.g., Truck, Ship) based on delivery requirements.

## Applicability
Use the Factory Method when you donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.
